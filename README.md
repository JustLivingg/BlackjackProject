## Blackjack Project

## Topics
1. OOP
2. ArrayList with Sets.
3. Enums + Abstract classes.

## Lessons Learned
* Adding cards that are dealt to players hand was a challenge.
* Getting more familiar with instantiating different classes with OOP.

## How to run
1. Game starts with taking user input for how many players.
2. The game will cycle through the players and shuffling the deck and dealing cards.
3. Afterwards the code will determine if any players have a blackjack.
4. Code is implemented afterwards to check if dealer has blackjack.
5. If neither have blackjack the players will be able to hit or stay.
6. If player(s) go over 21 they bust.
